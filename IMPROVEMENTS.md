# OCR Improvements Summary

## Overview

The `ocr.py` file has been significantly improved to support page-by-page PDF processing with parallel execution and organized output structure. Here's a comprehensive summary of all the enhancements.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Page-by-Page Processing
- **New Function**: `split_pdf_by_pages(pdf_path)`
  - Splits multi-page PDFs into individual page files
  - Uses PyPDF2 for reliable PDF manipulation
  - Creates temporary files for each page
  - Automatic cleanup of temporary files

### 2. Parallel Processing
- **New Function**: `process_pdf_by_pages(pdf_path, max_workers=4)`
  - Processes multiple pages simultaneously using ThreadPoolExecutor
  - Configurable number of parallel workers
  - Handles API rate limits gracefully
  - Continues processing even if some pages fail

### 3. Organized Output Structure
- **New Function**: `create_output_directory()`
  - Creates timestamped output directories (format: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`)
  - Organized structure: `output/timestamp/page-number/`

- **New Function**: `save_page_result(output_dir, page_num, result)`
  - Saves results for each page in numbered directories (001, 002, etc.)
  - Creates both JSON and human-readable summary files
  - Handles errors gracefully with detailed error reporting

### 4. Enhanced Logging
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the application
- Logs processing progress, errors, and completion status
- Uses Python's built-in logging module with INFO level

### 5. Error Handling & Recovery
- Robust error handling for all operations
- Failed pages are logged but don't stop processing of other pages
- Temporary file cleanup even on errors
- Detailed error messages in output files

### 6. Backward Compatibility
- Maintained all existing functions for single-page processing
- Legacy `process_document()` function still works
- Existing environment variable configuration still supported

## New Dependencies

Added to `requirements.txt`:
- `PyPDF2>=3.0.0` - PDF manipulation and page splitting
- `requests>=2.28.0` - HTTP client for API calls

## Output Structure

```
output/
└── 20241201-143022/          # Timestamp when processing started
    ├── 001/                  # Page 1 results
    │   ├── result.json       # Raw API response
    │   └── summary.txt       # Human-readable summary
    ├── 002/                  # Page 2 results
    │   ├── result.json
    │   └── summary.txt
    ├── 003/                  # Page 3 results
    │   ├── result.json
    │   └── summary.txt
    ├── processing_summary.txt # Overall processing summary
    └── combined_results.json # All results combined
```

## New Functions

### Core Processing Functions
1. `split_pdf_by_pages(pdf_path)` - Splits PDF into individual pages
2. `process_pdf_by_pages(pdf_path, max_workers=4)` - Main multi-page processing function
3. `process_page_parallel(page_info)` - Processes single page in parallel context

### Output Management Functions
4. `create_output_directory()` - Creates timestamped output directory
5. `save_page_result(output_dir, page_num, result)` - Saves page results to files

### Enhanced Existing Functions
6. `process_document(pdf_path, page_num=None)` - Enhanced with page number logging
7. `main()` - Updated to use new multi-page processing by default

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
- `VISION_AGENT_API_KEY` - Landing AI API key (required)
- `BASE_PDF_PATH` - Directory containing PDF files (required)
- `PDF_NAME` - Name of PDF file to process (required)
- `MAX_WORKERS` - Number of parallel workers (optional, default: 4)

### Performance Tuning
- **Default**: 4 parallel workers
- **Recommended**: 2-8 workers depending on system and API rate limits
- **High-performance**: 8+ workers for fast systems
- **Slower connections**: 2-3 workers to avoid overwhelming API

## Usage Examples

### Basic Multi-Page Processing
```python
from ocr import process_pdf_by_pages

# Process with default 4 workers
result = process_pdf_by_pages("document.pdf")

# Process with custom number of workers
result = process_pdf_by_pages("document.pdf", max_workers=2)
```

### Single Page Processing (Legacy)
```python
from ocr import process_document

# Process single page
result = process_document("single_page.pdf")
```

### Command Line Usage
```bash
# Basic usage (uses environment variables)
python ocr.py

# With custom environment
MAX_WORKERS=2 python ocr.py

# Direct file processing
python -c "from ocr import process_pdf_by_pages; process_pdf_by_pages('sampledata/sample-multi.pdf')"
```

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- PDF splitting functionality
- Output directory creation
- Page result saving
- Error handling
- Parallel processing structure

### Running Tests
```bash
python test_ocr.py
```

## Benefits

### Performance
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple pages processed simultaneously
- **Reduced API Calls**: Each page processed independently
- **Fault Tolerance**: Failed pages don't stop entire process

### Organization
- **Structured Output**: Clear directory hierarchy
- **Timestamped Results**: Easy to track processing sessions
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed progress and error tracking

### Maintainability
- **Modular Design**: Each function has a single responsibility
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling throughout
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work

### Scalability
- **Configurable Workers**: Adjust based on system capabilities
- **Memory Efficient**: Temporary files cleaned up automatically
- **API Rate Limit Aware**: Configurable to respect API limits

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users
1. **No Changes Required**: Existing code continues to work
2. **Optional Enhancement**: Switch to multi-page processing for better performance
3. **Environment Variables**: Add `MAX_WORKERS` for performance tuning

### For New Users
1. **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Set Environment Variables**: Configure API key and file paths
3. **Run Multi-Page Processing**: Use `process_pdf_by_pages()` for best results

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] Progress tracking and resumable processing
- [ ] Batch processing of multiple PDFs
- [ ] Web interface for document upload
- [ ] Database integration for storing extracted data
